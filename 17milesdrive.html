		<h1>17 Miles Drive</h1>
	
		<p>
			17-Mile Drive is a scenic road through Pebble Beach and Pacific 
			Grove on the Monterey Peninsula in California, much of which 
			hugs the Pacific coastline and passes famous golf courses, 
			mansions and scenic attractions, including the Lone Cypress, 
			Bird Rock and the 5,300-acre Del Monte Forest of Monterey 
			Cypress trees. The drive serves as the main road through the 
			gated community of Pebble Beach. Inside this community, 
			nonresidents have to pay a toll to use the road. Like the 
			community, the majority of 17-Mile Drive is owned and operated 
			by the Pebble Beach Corporation. The 17-Mile Drive is a 
			17-mile-long scenic loop having four primary entrances - 
			the main highway entrance at California State Route 1, and 
			entrances in Carmel and Pacific Grove.

			At the north end, a portion of the early route through Pacific 
			Grove begins at the intersection of Del Monte Blvd and Esplanade 
			Street. The famous portion of 17-Mile Drive then begins a few 
			miles south of this point. The crossing of Highway 68 (Holman 
			Highway/Sunset Drive) and 17-Mile Drive marks the entrance to 
			Pebble Beach. From the Sunset Drive/Pacific Grove gate, the drive 
			runs inland past Spanish Bay, then adjacent to beaches and up 
			into the coastal hills, providing scenic viewpoints. The route 
			allows for self-directed travel and stopping, with frequent 
			turnouts along the roadway in many locations along the route. 
			Without stops, it takes a minimum of 20 minutes to reach Carmel. 
			The numerous turnouts allow stopping to take pictures, or 
			getting out to stroll along the ocean or among the trees. 
			Visitors receive a map that points out some of the more scenic 
			spots. In addition, a red-dashed line is marked in the center 
			of the main road to guide visitors, and help prevent them from 
			venturing into the adjacent neighborhood streets.
