		<h1>Yosemite National Park</h1>
	
		<p>
			Yosemite National Park is an American national park in 
			California, surrounded on the southeast by Sierra National 
			Forest and on the northwest by Stanislaus National Forest. 
			The park is managed by the National Park Service and covers 
			an area of 759,620 acres and sits in four counties, centered 
			in Tuolumne and Mariposa, extending north and east to Mono and 
			south to Madera County. Designated a World Heritage Site in 
			1984, Yosemite is internationally recognized for its granite 
			cliffs, waterfalls, clear streams, giant sequoia groves, lakes, 
			mountains, meadows, glaciers, and biological diversity. Almost 
			95 percent of the park is designated wilderness. Yosemite is 
			one of the largest and least fragmented habitat blocks in the 
			Sierra Nevada, and the park supports a diversity of plants and 
			animals.

			Yosemite National Park is one of the top must-see places 
            in all of America, not just California! Located in the Sierra 
            Nevada mountains, it boasts a wide range of attractions, 
            including five cascading 1,000-foot waterfalls, imposing sequoia
            trees, and 13 spacious campgrounds. Visitors can enjoy such gorgeous, scenic locations as Glacier 
            Point, which overlooks Half Dome, High Sierra, Tenaya Canyon, 
            and even the Vernal and Nevada Falls in the distance.
			The geology of the Yosemite area is characterized by granite 
			rocks and remnants of older rock. About 10 million years ago, 
			the Sierra Nevada was uplifted and tilted to form its unique 
			slopes, which increased the steepness of stream and river beds, 
			resulting in the formation of deep, narrow canyons. About one 
			million years ago glaciers formed at higher elevations which 
			eventually melted and moved downslope, cutting and sculpting 
			the U-shaped valley that attracts so many visitors to its scenic
			vistas today.
