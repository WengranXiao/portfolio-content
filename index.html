			California varies greatly, ranging from the forested northern 
			coastal regions to the rugged interior mountains to the harsh 
			southern desert. Sandwiched in the center of California is the 
			fertile Central Valley, home to a massive amount of agriculture.
			California was recognized as a state in 1850, and its population
			increased steadily since then. Today California is the most 
			populous state in the US with over 38 million residents.
