			California is the largest state of the United States by 
			population, and the third largest by area, located on its 
			coast to the Pacific Ocean. California has natural attractions 
			as well as theme-parks and bustling city life: Southern 
			California is home to such popular attractions as Disneyland, 
			Hollywood and the beaches in Malibu that inspired the television 
			show Baywatch, while the northern part of California offers the 
			iconic Golden Gate Bridge, the hills of San Francisco, the 
			vineyards of Napa Valley, Silicon Valley, and the capital, 
			Sacramento. Outside California's major cities one finds some 
			of North America's most rugged national parks, incredible 
			skiing/snowboarding opportunities, and quiet and ancient northern 
			forests including the highest mountain peak in the contiguous 
			USA, Mt. Whitney.

			The state's climate varies from temperate at the coast to the 
			brutal winters of the mountains to one of the world's hottest 
			regions in the deserts. Rainfall is more common in the northern 
			part of the state than in the south, and snow is rare except in 
			the mountains. The hottest temperature ever recorded in the 
			Western Hemisphere, 134°F (56.6°C) was at Death Valley in 1913, 
			and temperatures regularly exceed 120°F (49°C) during the summer.
			In contrast, winter temperatures in the mountains can drop below 0°F.
